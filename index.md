## Introduction as a Programmer
**Hello World!**
Or probably I should say
```
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```

I'm Weiwen Dong, a junior student at UCSD who majors in *Bioinformatics*. I am a programmer who enjoys ***web development***, and have built RPG website game [Memorize](https://w3dong.github.io/memorize/) and website application like a [to-do-list app](https://shielded-thicket-02071.herokuapp.com/) and [blog website](https://sleepy-bayou-84869.herokuapp.com/) from scratch.
I am good at using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, and other popular tools to implement good ideas I think of. 

Quoting my favorite sentence:
> Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice
I am doing my best to study modern tools and making my ideas come to real life with new knowledge I learned. 
If you are interested, here is the list for what I am planning on to improve/learn in the following quarters
- javascript
- typescript
- react
- microservies
- system design and model
- API design, RESTful API, and implementations
- ... and more!
