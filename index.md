## Introduction as a Programmer
**Hello World!**
Or probably I should say
```
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```

I'm Weiwen Dong, a junior student at UCSD who majors in *Bioinformatics*. I am a programmer who enjoys ***web development***, and have built RPG website game [Memorize](https://w3dong.github.io/memorize/) and website application like a [to-do-list app](https://shielded-thicket-02071.herokuapp.com/) and [blog website](https://sleepy-bayou-84869.herokuapp.com/) from scratch.
I am good at using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, React, and other popular tools to implement good ideas I think of. 

Quoting my favorite sentence:
> Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice

I am doing my best to study modern tools and making my ideas come to real life with new knowledge I learned. 

If you are interested, here is the list for what I am planning on to improve/learn in the following quarters.

- javascript
- typescript
- react
- microservies
- system design and model
- API design, RESTful API, and implementations
- ... and more!
  
## Introduction as Me
I am also a ***baker, writer, and photographer***, who enjoys cooking, filming, and writing blogs about various food I made in my spare time. 

If I have to rank foods that I'm good at cooking

1. Desserts! (Cake, Cookie,..)
2. Chinese, Japanese, Korean food
3. Italian (I home-made pizzas and pastas)
4. ..More food to discover!

Maybe you wonder about what food I want to learn and make?

That's all for today.
